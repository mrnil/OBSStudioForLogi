# TODO

## High Priority

No items.

## Medium Priority

### Audio

- [ ] Audio level meters (real-time VU meters) — **deferred** until obs-websocket-dotnet supports InputVolumeMeters high-volume event subscription
- [ ] Audio filter enable/disable toggle
- [ ] Stereo balance controls
- [ ] Audio quick presets ("Mute All", "Reset All Volumes")

### Transitions

- [ ] Transition selection (choose type and duration)

## Low Priority

- [ ] Audio sync offset controls (set-and-forget, rarely adjusted mid-stream)
- [ ] Audio track assignment (multi-track recording)
- [ ] Scene item transforms (position, scale, rotation)
- [ ] Scene/source creation from hardware
- [ ] Filter settings adjustment (not just toggle)
- [ ] Get current preview scene (studio mode)
- [ ] Trigger OBS hotkeys from hardware (fallback for third-party plugin actions)

## Events Not Yet Subscribed

- [ ] `CurrentPreviewSceneChanged` — studio mode preview tracking
- [ ] `InputNameChanged` — input list sync when renamed in OBS
- [ ] `InputAudioBalanceChanged` — audio balance display
- [ ] `InputAudioSyncOffsetChanged` — audio sync display
- [ ] `InputAudioTracksChanged` — track assignment display
- [ ] `SourceFilterCreated` / `SourceFilterRemoved` — filter list updates
- [ ] `SourceFilterEnableStateChanged` — filter state display
- [ ] `CurrentSceneTransitionChanged` — transition display
- [ ] `SceneTransitionStarted` / `SceneTransitionEnded` — transition progress

## Architecture (Deferred)

- [ ] Multi-instance OBS support (see `.amazonq/rules/memory-bank/multi-instance-obs-design.md`)
- [ ] Dependency injection for StatsService (inject Func<OBSStats> instead of static singleton)
